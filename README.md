# high-performance-llm_planning
High-performance path planning with JAX, CUDA, and Differentiable Simulation, integrating LLM-guided heuristics and RL-based adaptive planning. Benchmarks A* search against JAX-accelerated, CUDA-parallelized, and differentiable optimization methods. Explores scaling laws in compute, model size, and data efficiency.
